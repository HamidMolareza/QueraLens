## About

**QueraLens** is a static site generator designed to display solutions for the Quera site. It works in tandem with the *
*[quera-readme-generator](https://github.com/HamidMolareza/QueraReadmeGenerator)** project, which extracts and formats
information into a static, user-friendly website.

### Purpose

The main goal of QueraLens is to enhance the user experience (UX) by incorporating features like search and filtering,
making it easier to navigate and find specific solutions.

### Problem It Solves

Solutions stored in repositories can be difficult to browse and search. By generating a static site with advanced search
and filtering capabilities, QueraLens improves organization and accessibility, ensuring users can quickly locate the
information they need.

### Why It Matters

This project adds significant value by:

- Automating the creation of a well-structured, easily navigable static site.
- Improving UX through intuitive design and interactive features like search and filter.
- Streamlining workflows with GitHub Actions, enabling automatic site updates whenever new solutions are added.

### Integration with GitHub Actions

QueraLens can be paired with **[quera-readme-generator](https://github.com/HamidMolareza/QueraReadmeGenerator)** in a
GitHub Actions workflow to automatically generate and update the static site whenever new Quera solutions are pushed to
the repository. This ensures your site remains current without manual intervention.

QueraLens is the ideal tool for developers who want to present their Quera solutions in a polished, functional, and
user-friendly format.
